# Overview 
Led an agile development team of three others through the products lifecycle for a remote client in Roatán Honduras to notify patients in remote areas that have appointments. I was responsible for configuring the backend using Mongo and Node.js, implementing SMS messaging through 3rd party services, and containerized everything using Docker. What we gave our client was a more robust product with user auth, a encrypted database, messaging, and an intutive UI.
